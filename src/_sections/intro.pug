  mq-js was inspired by the [mq-scss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mq-scss) Sass mixin. I wanted to use media queries in JavaScript in a similar sort of way to how I was using media queries in my Sass code.


+o-demo({
  scss: `
// MQ-SCSS

@include mq(inside, 600px, 1000px) {
  // styles for screens
  // between 600px and 1000px
}
`,
  js: {
    es6: `
// MQ-JS

if (mq.inside(600, 1000)) {
  // functionality for screens
  // between 600px and 1000px
}
`,
  },
})
