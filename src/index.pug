      This documentation is best viewed on a Desktop computer or laptop for the sake of viewing the examples at all screen sizes.

      This documentation also assumes that you have the ability to use ES6 JavaScript syntax in your project. Try looking into [Yeogurt](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt) or [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) if you aren't already using ES6 syntax in your JavaScript.

      mq-js was inspired by the [mq-scss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mq-js) Sass mixin. I wanted to use media queries in javascript in a similar sort of way to how I was using media queries in Sass.

      If you haven't looked into [mq-scss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mq-js) I highly recommend checking it out. It makes writing media queries far easier than any other method.

        ## Setup

        Firstly, use `npm install mq-js --save` to add the npm module to your project. If you haven't used npm before, read through [this documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) to get set up.

        Now, create this simple `mq.js` file to set up your websites breakpoints.

    +demo({
      js: `
//mq.js file
"use strict";

import MQ from "mq-js";

//Define your Site break points here
const mq = new MQ({
  small: 600,
  medium: 980,
  large: 1200
});

export default mq;`,
    })

    p(style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em")
      strong OR

      Alternatively you can save the breakpoints into a JSON file, then import them.

    +demo({
      json: `
{
  "//" : "This is the breakpoints.json file",
  "small": 600,
  "medium": 980,
  "large": 1200
}`,
      js: `
//mq.js file
"use strict";
import MQ from "mq-js";
import breakpoints from './breakpoints.json';

const mq = new MQ(breakpoints);

export default mq;`,
    })

    :markdown
      The above breakpoints are what I will be using throughout the examples in this documentation.

      ## Basic usage

      Now that you have your break points set up, you can use them when calling the function.

      In the following example, the button wil only turn green if you click it when the browser window is above 980px wide.
